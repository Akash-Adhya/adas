## What is ADAS?

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are intelligent systems that help drivers by providing enhanced safety and driving experience. These systems utilize sensors, cameras, and control algorithms to:

- Detect potential hazards
- Automate certain driving functions
- Provide critical information to the driver
- Take preventive actions when necessary

## Why ADAS?

Key reasons for ADAS development:

- **Safety**: Reduces human error (cause of 94% of accidents - NHTSA)
- **Efficiency**: Optimizes driving patterns for fuel/energy savings
- **Comfort**: Reduces driver fatigue in traffic/long drives
- **Regulation**: Meets evolving automotive safety standards
- **Foundation**: Building block for autonomous vehicles

## Use Cases of ADAS

1. **Collision Avoidance** (Implemented)
2. **Lane Keeping Assist** (Implemented)
3. **Automatic Parking** (Implemented)
4. **Adaptive Cruise Control**
5. **Blind Spot Detection**
6. **Driver Drowsiness Detection**

## Manual Driving vs ADAS

| Feature            | Manual Driving      | ADAS Assisted Driving                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Obstacle Detection | Human reaction time | Real-time ultrasonic sensing          |
| Decision Making    | Driver-only         | Sensor data + microcontroller logic   |
| Parking Assistance | Manual estimation   | Automated distance-based logic        |
| Speed Control      | Driver input        | Controlled by predefined safety logic |
| Alerts & Warnings  | Horns / lights      | Automated buzzer + LED alerts         |
